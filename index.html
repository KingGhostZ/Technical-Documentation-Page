      <p>The Python language is a powerful object-orientated programming language. It is<br> extremely easy to learn and is used almost everywhere. The syntax is easy to learn <br>and understandable. Since the syntax is easy to understand and short, it allows for easy <br>application development and implecation. Down below will be two "Hello World!" <br>examples... </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>print("Hello World!")</code></li>
        <li><code>print('Hello World!')</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These basic two lines of code print the exact same thing of "Hello World!" except that<br> Python uses both double "" and single ''. Here are some more examples down below. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>print("My name is Jack")</code></li>
        <li><code>print('How is your day?')</code></li>
        <li><code>print('My life is amazing')</code></li>
        <li><code>print("Jackson is very tall!")</code></li>
        <li><code>print("What is your name. "</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>However it is standard to use the double hash when writing code due to the fact that <br>typically in other languages the double hash is utilized.  </p>

      <p>Python is known for it's easy use for storing and analyzing data. Whether it's is in <br>external modules and files or the lists and dictionaries. Python stores data typically in lists, <br>dictionaries, tuples, or sets. A list is unordered data that is stored within a python <br>variable. For example, you can make the variable a equal to integers, floating point <br>numbers, strings, other lists, and boolean data types. Which makes lists extremely easy to utilize.<br> They utilize the square brackets in order to store their information.<br> Dictionaries store data with key value pairs inside of curly brackets. For example,<br> you store a key value like city with the city you enter in. A tuple is a collection<br> of data that cannot be altered like coordinates. They also utilize <br>paranthesis to store their information. The last data collection type is a set which is <br>unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. Sets utilize the curly brackets just like dictionaries. </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Lists: </h4>
        <li><code>a = [1, 3, 7, 2, "Jacky", True]</code></li>
        <li><code>b = [2,6,2,1,45,365]</code></li>
        <li><code>c = ["Jake", "Chris", "Sam"]</code></li>
        <h4>Dictionaries: </h4>
        <li><code>a = {"Name": "Jake", "Age": 19}</code></li>
        <li><code>b = {"Alive": True, "Location": "USA"}</code></li>
        <li><code>c = {"Name": "Matthew", "Age": 305}</code></li>
        <h4>Tuples: </h4>
        <li><code>a = ("apple", "orange", "pear")</code></li>
        <li><code>b = (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1)</code></li>
        <li><code>c = ("Tuple",)</code></li>
        <h4>Sets: </h4>
        <li><code>a = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}</code></li>
        <li><code>b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</code></li>
        <li><code>c = {"Jacob", "Matthew", "Caleb"}</code></li>

      <p>If and else statments are conditional statements that only happen if something <br>is true. For example, if you make x = 0, then ask the computer does x = 0 then it <br>will print out a certan data. There are also elif statements that are if another <br>condition might be true if that if statement isn't correct. However, if the if statement <br>and the elif statements are false, then you can execute the else statement. This is when <br>all other conditions are false so therefore this will execute. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>x=0
          if x == 0:
             print(True)</code></li>
        <li><code>x="Dog"
          if x == "Mouse":
             print(Mouse)
          elif x == "Dog":
             print(Dog)</code></li>
        <li><code>x="Dog"
          if x == "Mouse":
             print(Mouse)
          elif x == "Dog":
             print(Dog)
          else: \
              print("Unknown")</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is also some nested if statements where there is an if statement within a if statement. </p>

      <p>Loops are a conditional statement where the computer will continue to run back <br>through the same block of code until it no longer is true. A while loop loops <br>through a block of code unlike a for loop that loops through a string or data type. <br>For example, while true, the while statement will continue to add numbers of <br>your choice until the statement is false. For loops will loop through a string or list that<br> will go through each letter or index to check or print that out.  Here are some <br>examples down below...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>x=o
          while x <= 10:
          print(x)
          x +=1</code></li>
        <li><code>x="string"
          for x in x:
          print(x)
          </code></li>
        <p>The first line of code will print out numbers 1 until it is larger than 10. The <br>second block of code will print out each letter of that string. Saying s t r i n g. <br>This could be very useful for large amounts of data within a list. </p>
      </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
    <header class="header-under">Functions</header>
    <article>
      <p>Utilizing the def statement which stands for define, you can create a function <br>that can execute a block of code at the users need. For example, a creator could define<br> a function that calculates the average value of a list, spell out each letter of a <br>string, or simply print "Hello World". This being said, they are extremeley useful<br> and can help a creator avoid repitition in typing their code. Functions could also<br> use parameters in order to calulate the desired numbers or print out a certain string. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>def add(num1, num2):
          return num1 + num2
          print(add(1, 3))</code></li>
        <li><code>def looping(string):
          for x in string: 
          print(x)
          looping(Banana)</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first block of code defines a function that returns one value added to another. <br>In order to display that function, you must add the parameters you wish to add <br>together and call that function in a print statement. For the next block of code, <br>it will loop through the parameter displayed and print out each piece of that parameter.<br> Like the example, it owuld spell out B a n a n a.  </p>

      <p>Classes can be complicated but one of the most powerful things in python. Python <br>is an object-oriented programming language and this is truly where the object comes<br> into Python. Classes are like the blueprints or the creation of the objects. They are <br>similar to creating your own data type within python. Classes utilize functions <br>in order to create certain functionalities of these objects. Such as a specific<br> student is an object. However, the student genre would be the class. Here is an <br>example below...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>class student: 
          def __init__(self, name, grade, age, gpa):
          self.name = name
          self.grade = grade
          self.age = age
          self.gpa = gpa</code></li>
        <li><code>student1 = student("Jacob", 2, 8, 4.0)
          print(student1.name)</code></li>
        <p>The first block of code is creating the class or the data type of a student. <br>With the initialized function we can create the parameters of this object such as the <br>name, grade, age, and gpa of an individual student. Then, we can finally create the<br> object by assigning data to each of these parameters of this function inside of a <br>variable. Which we do in the second block of code. </p>
      </ul>
